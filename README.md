Brain Tumor Detection Deep Learning Model
Overview
This project implements a deep learning model for the detection of brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to classify MRI images into two categories: images containing brain tumors and images without brain tumors.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of MRI images of the brain, with labels indicating the presence or absence of tumors. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to train the model, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate performance, respectively.

Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used for this task is as follows:

Input Layer: Accepts MRI images as input.
Convolutional Layers: Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions to extract features from the input images.
Pooling Layers: Max pooling layers to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
Flattening Layer: Flattens the feature maps into a 1D vector for input to the fully connected layers.
Fully Connected Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation functions for classification.
Output Layer: Output layer with a sigmoid activation function to produce binary classification probabilities.
Training
The model is trained using the training set with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization and binary cross-entropy loss. The hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs are tuned using the validation set to optimize model performance.

Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on the test set to assess its performance in detecting brain tumors. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to measure the model's performance. Additionally, confusion matrices and ROC curves may be generated for further analysis.
